# Getting a glance on the IP:

This repository has files needed to design and implement a Programmable CMOS current comparator.

1) Download the Understanding CMOS Comparator word doc provided in this repository.
2) Carefully study it to understand the use of this IP and check the references section for the research papers and weblinks that are used to analyze the IP in depth.
3) Download and read the Applications of Current Comparator to understand the practical uses of a current comparator.

# Setting up the simulator:
Steps to install NI multism on windows 10 and opening the schematic provided:
1) go to the following link https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/ni-multisim/#gref 
2) click the download button 
3) open the .exe file from the downloads
4) click ok on the dailouge box opened and unzip the file to your preffered destination on the PC
5) After the files are unzipped click on install NI circuit design suite 14.0 and continue the installation process
6) Download the Basic Circuit with extension .ms14 provided in this repository.
6) Now open NI multism and go to File and click open and browse the downloaded Basic Circuit file and click open.

Overview of the schematic:
1) Once the steps mentioned above are done in the same order, a schematic circuit opens, which is first circuit required in the process of simulation.
2) You can see that all the components and the Voltage and Current sources are clearly annotated.
3) M1-M7 are the MOS Transistors and the values just adjacent to them are the channel length and width of the MOS respectively.
4) You can understand the working of the circuit by reading the CMOS Comparator Simulations doc file provided in this repository.

Running the simulations:
1)You can find a PLAY button on the third row from the top, this button is used to start the simulation and the stop button is used to stop the simulation, which you can find beside the pause button.
